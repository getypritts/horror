    <p align="cenetr">Humanity, in its current state, has existed for about a quarter of a million years, but only the last 4,000 have had any significance.So what have we been doing for almost 250,000 years? We huddled in caves, around small fires, afraid of things we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the Sun rose, it was the mystery of huge birds, with human heads and stones that came to life. So we called them 'gods' and 'demons', begging them to spare us and praying for salvation.After a while, their numbers dropped and ours grew. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, however, the inexplicable will never truly disappear, as if the universe demanded the absurd and impossible.Humanity must not go back into hiding in fear. No one will protect us, we must fight for ourselves.While the rest of humanity lives in the light, we must live in the darkness to combat it, maintain it, and protect it from the public eye, so that others can live in a normal, safe, and sane world.scp-logo-signature.pngWe assure you. We contain. We protect.â€“ The Administrator</p>
