    <p>[START REGISTRATION]Dr. Joseph arrives at the front parking lot of Site-19. A large hanging sign reads "SITE-19 GARAGE SALE!!!" Various anomalies are laid out on the tables. Dr. Diane is sitting at the cash register talking to someone else.JOSEPH: What the fuck, Diane?DIANE: Oh… give me a second, Josh!Diane takes the person's money and gives them a sample of SCP-686 in return. She then turns to Joseph.DIANE: Sorry, you have my full attention right now. What did you want?JOSEPH: I don't want anything. This "garage sale" is a clear violation of Foundation regulations.DIANE: What? As?JOSEPH: Oh, I don't know... Breaking the veil? Breaking the containment of God knows how many anomalies? And I'm sure that's enough to cause more than one XK-Class Scenario.DIANE: Okay… that's a good point… but… have you ever considered trying a sample of 686?JOSEPH: Oh, well, I always wanted to… hey! Don't try this on me!DIANE: Eh, it was worth a try.JOSEPH: How the hell did you manage to organize something like that?DIANE: The O5 Council let me do it.JOSEPH: The O5 Council…? Let me see the message.Diane takes a photo of the coat and gives it to Joseph. Joseph examines the sheet.JOSEPH: So fake it hurts!DIANE: It's not!JOSEPH: You literally wrote "Council 05" in crayon here. You should have put the letter O, not the number zero.DIANE: Well, no one told me that!JOSEPH: Look, I'm in a good mood today, okay? So if you close this sale, I can release you now without any severe punishment.DIANE: So what you're saying is... If I stop selling the anomalies, will I be able to get out without punishment?JOSEPH: Correct.Diane stops for a few seconds to think. Suddenly, she grabs a child who was passing by and starts whispering in his ear.DIANE: Listen... The elites don't want you to know this, but the anomalies at this site are free. You can take them home. I have 458 anomalies in my own house right now. Spread the message.JOSEPH: Diane, what the fuck?[CLOSE REGISTRATION]</p>
