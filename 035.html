This box must be permanently contained in a chamber shielded with steel, iron and lead. Doors must be triple locked at all times, except to allow employees to exit or enter. At least two (2) armed guards must be constantly posted. Guards must remain outside, and are not permitted to enter the containment chamber under any circumstances. A trained psychologist should always remain in the area. Researchersmust never touch SCP-035. SCP-035 is to be moved to a new sealed box every two (2) weeks. The previous box must be disposed of via SCP-101, as this object shows no adverse reaction to SCP-035's "corruption". Any individual who comes into contact with SCP-035 while it is possessing a host must be immediately psychologically evaluated.Description: SCP-035 has the appearance of a comedy mask, made of white porcelain, however, it occasionally adopts the form of a tragedy mask. In these events, all visual records of SCP-035, such as photographs, videos, and even illustrations, automatically change to reflect the object's new appearance.
