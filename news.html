   <p align="center">Description: A realistic oil painting measuring 42 cm x 60 cm. The painting illustrates a natural landscape representing the fauna and flora of the Amazon rainforest. The elements of the scene, however, present movement and sentience, behaving like an ecosystem perfectly in balance and obeying the laws of Physics. Detailed observations revealed that the species depicted in the painting behave exactly like their real representatives. Since ██/██/2019, the painting illustrates a landscape devastated by fires and devoid of fauna and flora.Recovery Date: 08/27/1996Recovery Location: Niterói, RJ, Brazil.Current Status: In possession of the PT10 Site Research Center.</p>

D-Class: And what the hell are you using?
</br>
Dr. Iceberg: A suit. Updated technology that NASA based its spacesuits on.
 <br>
[At this point, Dr. Iceberg connected to the oxygen tank and pulled the suit's hood up. Several seconds later, a common weapon is thrown into the room. Object lands near D-██-2348's feet, and soon transforms into a copy of the man.]
</br>
D-Class: What the-
 <br>
Dr. Iceberg: Come on, haven't you seen stranger things? You've been here for a month, haven't you?
</br>
D-Class: Yes, well-
 <br>
Dr. Iceberg: Eh, never mind. Just keep still and you'll be free to go in no time. Hm… push him back a few feet. So, 135, can you speak?
</br>
[3 minutes of silence, with 135 simply copying D-██-2348]
 <br>
Dr. Iceberg: No last words then? Oh, okay. Goodbye you, hello promotion.
</br>
[Dr. Iceberg holds and presses a glowing blue button, at which point a small ball of ice shoots from the ceiling into 135's "head", and soon begins to turn into gas]
 <br>
D-Class: And what is this?
</br>
135: [Intelligible language]
<br> 
Dr. Iceberg: A ball of solid nitrogen.
